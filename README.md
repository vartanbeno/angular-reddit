# Angular Reddit

This is a fun little project in which I play around with the Reddit API.

## Running

First, make sure you have Angular 6 installed. Then clone the repository and run `ng serve` to start up the application. Then visit [localhost:4200](https://localhost:4200).

You will be presented with a form asking which subreddit(s) you'd like to query against, and the type/timespan of posts you'd like to get as results.

<div align="center">
    <br/>
    <img src="./images/form.png" alt="Form" />
    <br/><br/>
    <img src="./images/results.png" alt="Results" />
</div>
